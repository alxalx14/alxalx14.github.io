			<h2>Projects</h2>
			<h3>Stay Online</h3>
			<p>StayOnline: This is a project I worked on that allows you to switch between backend IPs using Cloudflares API to change the A record for your domain when one of your IP addresses is offline. It can also activate Under Attack Mode when a timeout occurs to protect your website and keep legitimate traffic flowing freely.</p>

			<h3>Port Scanner</h3>
			<p>I have been working on a port scanner recently in python, it is made to be as fast at scanning as possible while using minimal system resources. <a href="https://github.com/alxalx14/PortScanner">Click to go to repo</p></a>

			<h3>Discord Message Logger</h3>
			<p>One project that I have personally taken a liking to is my message logger for discord, there's a lot to it so I will highlight some points. All messages including images and other files are logged to JSON files from servers, private messages, and groups. It can be used as a normal bot or selfbot depending on user preference. Lastly for my points, when the file sizes get larger it uses uJSON for better speeds. For more info <a href="https://github.com/alxalx14/Discord-Logger">Click to go to repo</p></a>
